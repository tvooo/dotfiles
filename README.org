* Dotfiles
This is my dotfiles repository. It's used to synchronise my configuration on my
work laptop, personal laptop, Raspberry Pi and other systems.

It's powered by [[https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot][Dotbot]]

** Prerequisites
Make sure the following are installed:
- python, git, zsh
- ripgrep (for Doom)
- [[https://input.fontbureau.com/][Input Mono]], including the Narrow variant (for Doom)

** Setting up a new machine

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone git@github.com:tvooo/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install
#+END_SRC

The install script will tell you when links couldn't be created. Make sure to port over any host-specific shell configuration into =~/.host.sh= and remove your =.bashrc= and =.zshrc=.

** TODO Updating files
